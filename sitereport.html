		<p class="description">On 11th may 2021, I got mail from college that stated how to login to NILE and provided me with student id. But, I was unable to login so, it caused a lot pressure and tension. Then the main tension started on 12th may (the day I recived assignment).</p><br>
		<p class="description">On 12th may 2021, our lecturer Ankit Thapa, provided us with assignment for web CSY1018 after opening and going through details in assignment I got scared. First of all, we needed to submit assignment on NILE which was not working. Secondly, I didn‚Äôt understand a lot of things as this was the very first assignment for me and due to COVID-19 our classes were online which was less effectivce compared to physically attended class. So, I started searching portfolio examples of various people on google to make a plan for skeletal layout. My plan was ready to execute first navigation, second home page, third portfolio page, fourth contact page, fifth CV page, finally validation and site report.So, at very first i stared to watch a video related to basic css.(CodeWithHarry, 28 april 2021) </p><br>

		<p class="description">     After briefing conducted on 14th may & 16th may I finally grasp the core of the assignment till then I had already started to make navigation bar for all pages, but didn‚Äôt push it on git hub until I was clear about assignment. Afterwards, my navigation bar and home page was nearly completed but, there was issue with size of my background Image in my home page so, I tried various types of background attribute, using background-size and background-position I solved it.

		<p class="description">Text was underlined in navigation bar there were margins and other styles without any external css applied. So, considering there will be issue with default css style while working on home page I applied css for whole assignment using *{ } to neglect/change some default css & I also watched video related to the assignment.

<p class="description">On 18th may, I was following my plan and working on portfolio page when issue occurred the blank image file didn‚Äôt provide required area in page as per instruction given in css file. I couldn‚Äôt solve the issue so, I linked image file downloaded from (Quality Nonsense Ltd, 2017).Then the problem was solved. In my opinion, box of blank images were not eye catching and it didn‚Äôt have the description so, I styled them by keeping data in different div with different class or id and gave then their respective description so that , the reader would get some idea/information about the reason of empty places in this page.</p><br>

	<p class="description">      19th may, I was following my usual schedule planning design of contact page. Unfortunately,  I was feeling uneasy for some days and on that day I got seriously ill all of a sudden and had to take a week of bed rest. This disturbed all the planning I made so, I was in a bit tension. After 2 days I started working on my assignment about 1-2hr daily till 27 may. During these days, I made div for my form and div for my contact details I got a lot of help from w3schools ( Refsnes data,1999) I tried different kinds of background image in home page and contact page and kept the satisfied one. Time passed by, I was already fine and started to design layout for my CV page on hard copy.</p><br>

	<p class="description" >On 27th may, according to the portfolio of various people I had a basic understanding of contents in each page so, today I planned to add details such as academic qualification and job experience on CV page. It was going smooth I didn‚Äôt need any help while listing the data I encountered a major problem i.e sub list inside list so, I once again reviewed video recording of the time when ankit sir taught us tables and forming list, I also visited w3schools ( Refsnes data,1999). I got some help but it wasn‚Äôt as perfect as I expected but as my first assignment some small dissatisfaction I let it goand used (div) (li) and (br) tag.</p><br>

    <p class="description">My basic assignment was done but it was still incomplete. But still I planned to check my assignment with W3C Markup Validator. I was shocked by the result there were many errors which were all basic error that I didn‚Äôt know when as it was not taught. So, it caught my interest and I checked all pages and solved a lot of problems. I also learned a lot like, (a) tag is never inside button tag, section tag need heading tag inside, need to specify language, always type open and close tag together so that there is less chance of forgetting to close tag or typing extra close tag, (li) tag is never inside div tag, (img) tag always needs alt=‚Äù‚Äù so specify data in image if image doesn‚Äôt load. I successfully corrected/validated the assignment on 29 may.</p><br>

    <p class="description">  On 29th may I planned on what to write on and how to write site report and started to write my site report based on date. I tried to login to NILE it was unsuccessful until 30 may, as on 30th may my NILE issue was finally solved and checked deadline for assignment but it was not there I inquired with Ankit sir, he said not fixed so I completed my site report as soon as possible and I included screenshots of validation error and correction. I also tried changing background images with pictures I took.  </p><br>
    <p class="description">On 31st may,As main assignment was done I was reviewing it I found something is needed so I again reviewed all things that I learned and found I didn‚Äôt use animation and grid. So, I planned to use animation today and also change the contents of site report.</p><br>
